            <p class="sectiontag bigtext">End of illiteracy is here</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag smalltext">“Literacy”, the ability to read and write, is often equated with “education”, but is not the same. Literacy is a step to education. For me, education is the complete development of a person in terms of knowledge, sensibility and most important, behaviour in different situations.

                Let us take an example of a person who knows very well to read and write. Say, his entire schooling has been done in an English medium school. He is very fluent in English. Thus, we can say that he is literate. But can we say that he is well educated? I doubt. I can say he is educated only if his knowledge and information gained is reflected in his actions. If a person uses foul language and abusive words, then he can’t be considered an educated person. Action of an educated person is imbued with a sense of calm and serenity.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag bigtext">what is Education?</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag smalltext">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.

                Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.
                
                A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular for evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag bigtext">how Education helps you to become successfull</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag smalltext">I believe education is the most important tool you can receive, that can bring you most success in society today. Education lessens the challenges you will face in life. The more knowledge you gain the more opportunities will open up to allow individuals to achieve better possibilities in career and personal growth. Education has played an important role in the career world of the twenty-first century. A person with a higher education will be easily qualified compared to a person without an extended education; as one will be prepared to do various tasks that careers demand as well as meet job standards.</p>
            <p>
                I also believe education is important because it helps us develop a unique perspective of looking at life. Education has played a major role for all individuals in the society. It has allowed the community to succeed both socially and economically by enabling it to develop common culture and values. Education is the reason our world is the way it is today, doctors have been close to finding cures for cancer because of a higher education; our technology has been enriched compared to the 19th century all because of education.
